SWE, heavy on mobile dev, so-so in the other 'regular' dev.  
Most of my work still leans toward mobile, but these days I wear more hats.  

I pursue graphics programming in my own time, not just a passing interest, but a path I actively invest in.

## What I do

I build and maintain software across platforms mostly mobile, but also backend and supporting systems when needed.  

Outside of work, I pursue a couple of paths more deliberately:
- Game development, prototyping ideas, joining jams, and slowly shaping a small commercial project.
- Graphics programming, something I pursue in my own time. Right now that means learning Vulkan, experimenting with rendering pipelines, and building a basic renderer.


## Philosophy

I care about the process as much as the product.

I like understanding how things work under the hood, memory, data, execution, the stuff the CPU actually does.
That doesn’t mean I reject abstraction. 

Still, I find value in knowing what’s really happening. Even if I’m not optimizing every bit of memory, I like having that mental model.

I also believe that someone should have a handcrafted environment that works for them.

I use:
- Neovim
- Arch Linux + Sway
- I type on a split keyboard using AKL (Night)

I want tools that feel like limbs, responsive, precise, frictionless.  
I’m not saying everyone needs to use Vim. I’m saying you should explore deeply enough to know what works for you. Use VSCode? Great. Just know why.

I’m also forcing myself to get fluent with Windows, even though I hate it.  
I want to be coconut oiled, even in the mud.  
Plus it seems that the graphic / game dev side of things mostly happens there.


## Hobbies

Gaming's always been part of my life, but my taste evolved.

- **PS1/PS2 days**: bought games by their covers. Pure vibes.
- **Teen years**: obsessed with AAA. Back when big publishers rarely missed.
- **Later**: fell into the Dota / CS hole. Thousands of hours.  
- **Now**: back to vibe-based games that *look* cool.

I also read a lot of **manga and manhwa**.  
Yes, I know my taste is shallow.  
A deep, well-written story with complex characters? Fine, sure.  
But the 546th 6/10 isekai with an overpowered protagonist? Good shit.  
Another power fantasy manhwa with recycled concepts? We eating good tonight.

I'm also a fan of **Uma Musume**.  
The horses just speak to me.  
My head hurts from nodding and trueing. These horses are literally me.

And then there's **Touhou**. I don't fully know why I love it.  
Maybe because it's the first open source game with a million forks, some of which aren't even games anymore.  
Also: **Akatsuki Records** is my favorite circle.  
Followed closely by **Tumeneco**.


## What This Site Is

This site is a small corner of the internet for the things I build and think about.  
If you're into custom tooling, low-level graphics, or discussing how the protagonist farmed aura for the 50th time in chapter 50 - we might get along.
