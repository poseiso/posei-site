I proclaim I'm over it,  
yet I can't deny the part of me  
that is still trapped within those days.  

The days burned brightly,  
way too bright.  
A light that brilliant  
was a sign it couldn't last.  

The fact that I still try to reclaim what was lost  
is the final, honest proof:  
I am not over it.  

How can I be?  
I even doubt my right to the name "Posei."  

As hurtful as it is,  
I have no more lingering regrets.  
No more shouting at the horizon,  
expecting an answer.  

The moon waxes and will not fail to wane.  
The tide rises; the wave recedes.  

And so, I try to move forward,  
with or without Posei.  

Not as a surrender,  
but as a proclamation.  

I will honor those who shared the path with me.  
I will thank that past self  
for showing me the peak of our possibility,  
when nothing else mattered.  

But even having said all this...  
if I am forced to look back,  
it still stings.  

Perhaps I will never truly be over it.  
Or perhaps...  
this sting is not a wound,  
but my very soul refusing to let go  
of a fire that once defined it.
