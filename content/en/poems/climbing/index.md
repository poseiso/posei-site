i did not just climb a wall.  
i climbed a moment.  
a shaking, uncertain moment  
caught between fear and ascent.  

my breath trembled,  
my limbs screamed,  
but i moved anyway.  

that wall didn't test my strength  
it revealed it.  
the fall never came.  
i rose.  

and when i reached the top,  
it wasn't just the height that shook me.  
it was the knowing:  
“something has changed.”  

i didn't just unlock a new skill.  
i unlocked access  
to places in me i didn't know i could reach  
not just forward, but behind.  

i've found a door i can return through.  
i've felt the joy of motion,  
the glory of effort,  
and the quiet magic of doing it with someone who gets it.  

i was higher than the wall.  
and i'm not coming back down the same.
